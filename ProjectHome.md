# A classic top-down scrolling shooter game -- with a twist! #

Here you are in your shiny new plane, flying along peacefully as the beautiful countryside unrolls beneath you. Sure, there's the odd turret shooting at you, but of course you know how to deal with _those_!

Soon enough, you make it to the distant big city. Looks like your mission was successful. But what's that? You get to do it all over again! And -- oh no, it can't be true, can it? A shadow of your own past self joins you! Will **past you** join **present you** to defeat the turrets all the better? Or does **past you** have something more sinister in mind? And what will happen when you finally make it to the city again?

## Making of ##
This game was created by the four team members within 48 hours (including about 20 hours of sleep) during the [Global Game Jam](http://www.globalgamejam.org/) 2012 ([submission page](http://globalgamejam.org/2012/memories-haunt-you)).

The game uses 3 out of the 15 [GGJ 2012 diversifiers](http://globalgamejam.org/wiki/achievements-diversifiers):
  * **_Followers_: (Increasing number of NPCs follow you)** The game involves a growing number of autonomous non-player characters that are always following the player character’s position.
  * **_I know what you did last…_: (Game changes between sessions)** The game mechanics or content will change in the next play session, based on the actions taken in the previous session.
  * **_Scribbl’d_: (All art is hand drawn)** All artwork is hand drawn and scanned in.

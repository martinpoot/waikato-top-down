This is the submission to the Global Game Jam by the team "Top Down". The title of the game is "Memories that haunt you".

Here you are in your shiny new plane, flying along peacefully as the beautiful countryside unrolls itself under you. Sure, there's the odd turret shooting at you, but of course you know how to deal with those!

Soon enough, you make it to the distant big city. Looks like your mission was successful. But what's that? You get to do it all over again! And -- oh no, it can't be true, can it? A shadow of your own past self joins you! Will past you join present you to defeat the turrets all the better? Or does past you have something more sinister in mind? And what will happen when you finally make it to the city again?

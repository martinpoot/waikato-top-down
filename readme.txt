Memories that haunt you
=======================

Here you are in your shiny new plane, flying along peacefully as the beautiful
countryside unrolls itself under you. Sure, there's the odd turret shooting at
you, but of course you know how to deal with those!

Soon enough, you make it to the distant big city. Looks like your mission was
successful. But what's that? You get to do it all over again! And -- oh no, it
can't be true, can it? A shadow of your own past self joins you! Will past you
join present you to defeat the turrets all the better? Or does past you have
something more sinister in mind? And what will happen when you finally make it
to the city again?

A game created during the Global Gam Jam 2012.

Installation instructions:
==========================

Rename the release directory to a name that you like and copy it to a
destination where it makes sense.

Run the game executable.

The Global Game Jam distributable only supports Microsoft Windows; OS X and
Linux versions will probably be added after the submission deadline.

Alternatively, if you have Apache Ant and a Java Development Kit installed, you
can compile and run the game by typing 
ant run
on the command line in the top-level directory of the distribution (i.e. in the
same directory in which this readme is located).
